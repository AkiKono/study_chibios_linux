## Installation
  
ChibiOS project provides a very convenient tool, which is ChibiStudio for windows users. Linux (and Mac) users need to install Eclipse, Cross tool chain, and OpenOCD by themself though, it is not too complex (Actually we even don't need to compile any tool). Here, I assume that you have a PC with Vanilla Ubuntu 16.04.
